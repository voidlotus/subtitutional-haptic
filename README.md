# Subtitutional Haptic in VR using Leap Motion 

Class project involving the use of Unity and Leap Motion to create an interactive haptic simulation within a Virtual Environment (VE). The focus of the project is to explore the extent to which external devices can replicate the sensation of being pinched on the skin, which is difficult to simulate accurately within a VE.
